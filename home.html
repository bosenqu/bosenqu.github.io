					My name is Bosen Qu. I am currently a Computer Science, Co-op student at University 
					of Waterloo. Prior to this, I was in Honours Mathematics, Co-op and got transferred 
					in May 2019. My biggest interests are mathematics and computer science. I cannot 
					express how I enjoy my linear algebra and cs courses (although they are tough). 
					I am planning to declare another major in Computational Mathematics and a minor in 
					Combinatorics & Optimization in 2020.

					I am the kind of person who likes everything organized. Before working, I always 
					spend time planning things ahead, and break the problem into several parts which I can 
					then solve them individually. I think that pre-planning allows us to have time to deal 
					with incidents occurred and deconstructing the problems can improve efficiency considerably. 
					Additionally, communication is another strength of me. I am well performed in both verbal and 
					written communication and believe that effective communications in workplace is a key to 
					success. Next year, I will be taking a subject-based communication course which improves my 
					communication in my own profession.

					Apart from study, I have many interests in life. I enjoy cooking and making cocktail drinks. 
					Boards games that involves logic such as Avalon can always attract me. I also enjoy playing 
					sports including badminton and Ultimate Frisbee. I am planning to add playing badminton to my 
					weekly plan.
